# Hypothesis-Testing-Video-Engagement-Covid
## Introduction
This project uses hypothesis testing and causal inference techniques to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the engagement with healthcare-related videos. Specifically, we aim to test the hypothesis: "Healthcare videos gained more attention during the COVID-19 outbreak."

The project is divided into the following key sections:
1. Data collection from YouTube videos, particularly from the Bao Thanh NiÃªn Channel.
2. Application of causal inference methods to analyze the data and test the hypothesis.
3. Classification of video titles using large language models (LLM).
4. Visualization and analysis of results.
